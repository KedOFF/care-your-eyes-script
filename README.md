# care-your-eyes-script
This script is designed to programmatically reduce the brightness of the monitor, which reduces the harm to the eyes from the monitor.
You can use the .exe file to start and run.
You can stop the script by simply closing the terminal.

Or you can modify the .py file in any way you want, make sure you have python installed and the necessary dependencies to run it from terminal. 
If you need to change the degree of darkness change line 6: TRANSPARENCY = 128 #0 (transparent) - 255 (not transparent)

The script does not work in absolute fullscreen mode, due to Windows limitations, I think, and because I do not know how to implement it.
Most likely the script will not work on Linux
